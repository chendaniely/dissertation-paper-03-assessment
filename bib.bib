  abstract = {Three studies using the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition were conducted over a period of 21 years. Nurses with a range of experience and reported skill-fulness were interviewed. Each study used nurses' narrative accounts of actual clinical situations. A subsample of participants were observed and interviewed at work. These studies extend the understanding of the Dreyfus model to complex, underdetermined, and fast-paced practices. The skill of involvement and the development of moral agency are linked with the development of expertise, and change as the practitioner becomes more skillful. Nurses who had some difficulty with understanding the ends of practice and difficulty with their skills of interpersonal and problem engagement did not progress to the level of expertise. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the usefulness of the Dreyfus model for understanding the learning needs and styles of learning at different levels of skill acquisition.},

  abstract = {Introduction Data Carpentry is a fiscally sponsored project of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit that supports world-class, innovative, open source scientific computing projects. The mission of Data Carpentry is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. This mission is achieved through the development and implementation of workshops taught on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Data Carpentry is a sibling organization of Software Carpentry, though its focus is on the introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. Data Carpentry lessons are domain specific, and range from life and physical sciences to social science. Lessons build upon the existing knowledge of learners to enable them to quickly apply the skills they learn to their own research. Data Carpentry learners are asked to complete pre- and post-workshop surveys. This report is an analysis of the post-workshop survey responses collected for 40 Data Carpentry workshop sites. Purpose The analysis in this report serves the following purposes: To inform the community of the impact Data Carpentry workshops have made on its learners. To provide context for the survey responses as they relate to Data Carpentry learners. To discuss what Data Carpentry is doing well, areas of improvement, and questions we should be asking.},
